Description: The SWEP B10Hx20 brazed plate heat exchanger is a compact counter-flow heat exchanger commonly used in, HVAC systems, industrial process cooling, heat recovery systems, and refrigeration and heat pump loops
It consists of thin stainless-steel plates brazed together with copper, forming alternating hot and cold flow channels that promote high heat transfer coefficients while maintaining a small footprint.

Real-world relevance: Similar exchangers are used in district heating plants, automotive thermal management systems, and industrial energy recovery, which makes this device directly applicable to mechanical and aerospace thermal systems.
How it works: Hot fluid enters one side of the exchanger while cold fluid enters from the opposite side, creating counter-flow operation. Heat is transferred by convection from the hot fluid to the plate, by conduction through the plate,  and by convection from the plate to the cold fluid

Assumptions: 
Steady State
Negligible kinetic energy and potential energy changes
No shaft work
Adiabatic externally (there is only heat transfer between the fluids)

Use Control Volume to Analyze This Thermodynamic System
Control Volume: Entire heat exchanger
Type: Steady-state, steady-flow control volume
