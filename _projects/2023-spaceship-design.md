### Problem Statement

Grape farmers in the Northeast US are invaded by spotted lanternflies (SLFs) that infiltrate harvests. The SLF population grows rapidly due to many nymphs surviving to adulthood, where they reproduce abundantly, increasing their population by a factor of 5.47. Current solutions primarily target adults, but rapid population growth is already occurring by this stage, increasing the severity of their impact regardless.

---

### Impact

Decreasing SLF’s reproduction factor from 5.47 will slow population growth and potentially stagnate it in an area, reducing the number of SLFs per vine from 400.

## Concept A (Primary): SLF Scraper

The Scraper would be a device that makes it quicker and simpler for SLF egg masses to be removed while allowing access to hard-to-reach locations. The user would spot egg masses visually or using the light feature, extend the scraper using a telescoping mechanism, and remove the egg masses into an enclosed housing.

#### Why it’s better than the status quo:

- Current SLF scrapers are credit card–sized and require close contact with egg masses  
- Our scraper simplifies the process and improves accessibility  

For our MVP, we will create a prototype that extends and contains egg masses and develop a preliminary UI. Long term, we will integrate a working UI, camera system, and improve reproducibility.

## Concept B: Nymph Netting

This involves weaving netting in a spiral formation to funnel and trap nymph SLFs that are unable to fly and climb trees to feed, preventing them from reaching adulthood. This targets nymphs specifically and uses recent research suggesting they respond to high-frequency vibrations.

---

## Key Risks / Unknowns

- Netting may unintentionally impact other wildlife, creating negative ecological effects. We will mitigate this by testing smaller-scale traps with different funnel geometries.
- Even if the scraper is effective, inconsistent user adoption will limit impact. We will conduct surveys to incorporate user feedback and improve usability.

## Questions

1. **What are your biggest frustrations with current scrapers used to remove egg masses?**  
   *Decision affected:* Helps improve user comfort and scraping efficiency.

2. **What traps are currently in use — how do they lure SLFs, and how effective are they?**  
   *Decision affected:* Allows us to refine trap mechanisms and avoid ineffective approaches.

3. **What are the main barriers to removing egg masses — height, geometry, or consistency?**  
   *Decision affected:* Informs scraper geometry and feature prioritization.
